## Archive: 22 Febraury 2021 | Prepare compelling and reproducible notebooks for the EnvDS book

### Sign up below

**Name + Which is your essential clothing accessory for frozen days? + an emoji to represent it ([emoji cheatsheet](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md))**

* Tim + Argyle + :socks:
* Ricardo + Scarf + :scarf: 

### Conversation Starters

* None

### Breakout rooms: Topic proposals

* No breakout rooms, all in the main room

### Notes and questions

* Alejandro went through the key steps to submit a notebook to the EnvDS book:
    * Step 1: Notebook idea
        * Log your notebook idea as a [new issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/environmental-ds-book/issues/new/choose) in the project repo
        * Once the idea is clear e.g purpose, data sources, packages,  and/or you receive a feedback from a collaborator or EnvDS community, you can move to the next step :arrow_down: 
    * Step 2: Preparation
        * Open a terminal in your local/remote machine.
        * Fork the EnvDS repository to your personal github account.
        * Clone the forked repository into your local/remote machine.
        * Go to the folder of the forked repository in your local/remote machine.
        * If the environmental system and/or topic doesn't exist create a folder in the forked repository.
        * Copy the template of your topic from the community chapter, (see [here](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/environmental-ds-book/tree/master/book/community/templates)).
    * Step 3: Setup
        * Open a terminal in your local/remote machine and change the current directory (path) to the directory of the forked repo.
        * Verify if you have `conda` i.e. type `conda`. If you don't get results after the verification, follow this [guide for installing conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html).
        * Prepare a conda environment for your notebook. Note the environment should use python version of the EnvDS book (python 3.8) and also install `jupyter` which is the library to edit the notebook. The lines below guide you to launch a `jupyter notebook` session, one of the `jupyter` interfaces to edit notebooks. 
            * conda create -n <environment_name> python=3.8 jupyter
            * follow the instructions to activate your environment
            * check the list of packages in the [environment.yml](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/environmental-ds-book/blob/master/environment.yml) of the EnvDS book. 
            * install relevant packages from the list using `conda install <package-name>`
            * type `jupyter notebook`
            * If a package relevant for your notebook isn't in the list, you can add a cell to install it before the import libraries section in the notebook. Packages can be installed using `pip -q install <package-name>` where `-q` means to install in silent mode. 
    * Step 4: Edit the the noebook
        * Once you have the environment ready for your notebook, you can modify the sections of the template.
        * (optional) follow the 10 rules of compelling notebooks provided by the EarthCube initiative available in their Notebook Template (section [Data processing and analysis](https://github.com/earthcube/NotebookTemplates/blob/main/EC_05_Template_Notebook_for_EarthCube_Long_Version.ipynb)).
        * Once happy with the first editions of the notebook. Save it and push the changes. Not sure how to push changes, follow [Turing Way community chapter in Github](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/github-novice.html).
    * Step 5: Open a pull request
        * Go to the forked github repository in your Github account. 
        * Click in contribute and open a pull request
            * ![](https://i.imgur.com/Fq8c0vR.png)
        * You'll see a form which you should fill and submit according to the information requested. 
        * Go to the EnvDS main repo and you'll see the PR as below:
            * ![](https://i.imgur.com/r9BekKL.png)
    * Step 6: Editions
        * Click in your pull request
            * To facilitate the interaction with the reviewer, we are using ReviewNB and Netlify previews. You can access to ReviewNB clicking in the purple buttom below:
            * ![](https://i.imgur.com/G5vEhDT.png)
        * Note you can continue implementing changes in the forked repo. They'll automatically will change the notebook in the PR. 
    * Step 6: Review
        * Once you're happy with the first version in the pull request, you can change to Ready to review in the checkbox.
        * A reviewer will be assigned to your pull request.
        * The reviewer will start a discussion of your notebook through the ReviewNB platform.
    * Step 7: Publication
        * Once both parties, author(s) and reviewer(s) are ha

### Breakout rooms: Topic proposals

* Main room (silent mode)
    * Bea: working on the submission of her PhD thesis.
    * Alejandro: 
        * adding helpful resources about FAIR and example of research repositories for Environmental Sciences.
        * checking which sample data within the Environmental Data Science book can be curated in [the Environmental Data Science Zenodo community](https://zenodo.org/communities/the-environmental-ds-community/?page=1&size=20).

### Notes and questions

* Alejandro
    * Useful resources about FAIR :
        * [FAIR Cookbook](https://fairplus.github.io/the-fair-cookbook/content/home.html): an online resource for the Life Sciences with recipes to make and keep data FAIR.
        * [The Turing Way: The FAIR Principles](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/reproducible-research/rdm/rdm-fair.html?highlight=fair): light introduction to FAIR principles, pointing to key resources in the topic.
        * [Library Carpentry: FAIR Data and Software](https://librarycarpentry.org/lc-fair-research/aio/index.html): lesson exploring the meaning of FAIR elements. 
    * Research data platforms:
        * General
            * [re3data.org](https://www.re3data.org/): initiative indexing research data platforms by content topic and knowledge domain.
            * [Stats datacite](https://stats.datacite.org/): dashboard mapping the registration of persistent identifiers (DOIs) for research data and other research outputs.
        * Environmental science (list of platforms with the highest number of total DOIs registrations according to Stats datacite):
            * [Global Biodiversity Information Facility](https://www.gbif.org/)
            * [FAO Global Information System of the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture (PGRFA)](https://ssl.fao.org/glis/)
            * [PANGAEA](https://www.pangaea.de/): earth system research.
            * [Environmental Data Initiative (EDI)](https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/home.jsp): platform suited to curate environmental data, includes code snippets to import the data across multiple programming languages (python, R).
            
    * Other interesting FAIR-driven platforms:
        * [ROHub](https://reliance.rohub.org/): research object management platform supporting the preservation and lifecycle management of scientific investigations, research campaigns and operational processes. It implements FAIR digital objects and specific metadata for data-cube in Earth Science. 

    * Challenges of FAIR data repositories for Environmental sciences (ES):
        * ES is structured as tabular data collected in the field or laboratory (see further discussion in [BEXIS2](https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/72901/)).
        * FAIR-enabled data available could be daunting for many ES researchers and organisations due to the lack of awareness, efficient data management tools, infrastructure and skills [see further discussion in BEXIS2](https://bdj.pensoft.net/article/72901/)).
        * Spatio-temporal (data cubes) > this seems to be adressed by novel research object management platforms such as [ROHub](https://reliance.rohub.org/).
    
### Request for reviews!

* EGU22 session was accepted, [Bridging the spatial scales, from surface sensors to satellite sensors: Innovative approaches towards the construction of Earth‚Äôs digital twin](https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU22/session/43565). Deadlines:
    * Abstract submission deadline: 12 January 2022, 13:00 CET
    * Travel Support application deadline: 1 December 2021

### Breakout rooms: Topic proposals

* Matt, making a reproducible GitHub code for his MRes dissertation
* Alejandro, preparing contributions guidelines for the Environmentel AI book 
* Sam J, exploration of resources for reproducibility and feedback on Matt and Alejandro's topics

### Notes and questions

* Sam J:
    *  [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome), a great resource to guide Environmental scientist in reproducible research.
    *  [Cornell Dataset Description](https://cornell.app.box.com/v/ReadmeTemplate) a good starting template for dataset documentation!
    *  Standards in data catalogues, e.g. [STAC](https://stacspec.org) (but it isn't mature)
* Alejandro:
    * Zenodo:
        * It is great to keep your sample data (up to 50 GB).
    * notebooksharing.space
        * A nice resource to share notebooks with interactive plotting (up to 10Mb). However, it doesn't allow track changes as [ReviewNB](https://www.reviewnb.com) does. 
    * Contributors guidelines for the EnvAI book
        * Sam suggests example environmental python packages with links to notebooks (e.g. hvplot, geopandas etc.)
        * Minimal publishable version guidelines e.g. Binder
        * Use external links for general versioning principles e.g. how to pull request in Github
        * Provide examples how to create lock environments 
        * Section of tools for sharing notebooks e.g. ReviewNB, notebooksharing.space
* Matt
    * Publishing reproducible code for environmental science
        * It can be more important that the process can be reproduced rather than accuracies to the nearest 0.01%
        * Use a subset of data to demonstrate the tool where the owners aren't happy to share the whole thing - training & inference
        * In env science a visual demonstration of the results can be more useful than a commandline readout of accuracy
        * Suggest sensible ranges for hyperparameters in the documentation

### Request for reviews!

* **Sam J**: reviewers need for SEVIRI wildfire data notebook of the EnvAI book, see [PR#12](https://github.com/acocac/environmental-ai-book/pull/12)

### Conversation Starters

* Met Office / Joint centre for excellence in environmental intelligence conference 16/17 Dec 2021!
* We have a fresh interactive notebook in the Environmental Data S Book :earth_asia::books: The notebook focuses on detecting tree crowns using the *DeepForest* model :deciduous_tree:. Have a look at the rendered version [here](https://acocac.github.io/environmental-ai-book/forest/modelling/forest-modelling-treecrown_deepforest.html). Other recent community contributions are the exploration of sensor data, [Met Office UKV high-resolution atmosphere model data for urban settings](https://acocac.github.io/environmental-ai-book/urban/sensors/urban-sensors-ukv.html) and [MODIS satellite imagery and wildfire data](https://acocac.github.io/environmental-ai-book/wildfires/sensors/wildfires-sensors-modis.html).

### Breakout rooms: Topic proposals

* Sam A. Manufacture Urban Data in GIS format
* Evie. Preprocessing satellite data for crop yield prediction
* Alejandro. Preprocess FluxNet data and related gridded products

### Notes and questions

* We showcased the [SEPAL platform](https://docs.sepal.io/en/latest/cookbook/area_estimation.html) for Vegetation Satellite Image analysis. 
* Discussed challenges around scoping and extracting satellite data for machine learning models of vegetation (agricultural crops):
    * Appropriate satellite platform (Sentinel/LANDSAT?)
    * Preprocessing of radar and optical data (i.e. dealing with cloud cover)
    * Appropriate time series/critical dates for plant growth
* Sam A. used ArcGIS pro to extract site-specific temperature information from a gridded netCDF dataset using the Spatial Analyst 'Sample' tool. It is very useful in that it works across the time dimension so I could do this for 1 year of data in one go. It is also possible to set a desired output coordinate system. I could save the data out as a csv file and then use standard python tools like pandas and numpy for further processing  
* Sam A. suggests using [Iris package](https://scitools-iris.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for reprojecting gridded netCDF files. The project is
* Data preprocessing is still too time-consuming, and there is lack of communication of the tools available.
