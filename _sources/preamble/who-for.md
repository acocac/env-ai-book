# Who is the book for?

While the scientific community is broad, we think the target audience of this book is:

* Researchers with some background in environmental science interested in AI and data science methods.
* Researchers with some background in computer science interested in environmental data science.  
* Anyone else interested in reproducibility, inclusive, shareable and collaborative AI and data science for environmental applications.

The interactive code in the book is mostly written in Python. If you are not familiar with the Python language and its scientific packages, we strongly suggest following [Pythia Foundations](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/landing-page.html) and [Earth and Environmental Data Science](https://earth-env-data-science.github.io/intro.html) e-books. Both are excellent community-driven learning resource for Python education in the Earth and Environmental Sciences.
