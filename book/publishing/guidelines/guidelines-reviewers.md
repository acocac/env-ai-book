# Guide for EDS Notebooks Reviewers

Welcome to the guide for notebooks reviewers of the EDS book! 

Before you begin this process, please be sure to [understand how the publication process works](pb-guidelines).

We have a [code of conduct](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alan-turing-institute/environmental-ds-book/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which is mandatory for everyone involved in the review process of our notebooks.

Below you will find the main steps we suggest to follow to review notebooks submitted to EDS book.

## Scope and Aims
Thank you for considering reviewing for EDS book.
Our review process aims to be collaborative, transparent and inclusive. 
We therefore welcome reviewers from a diversity of background and with varying levels of programming/domain expertise.

Previous reviews had a mix of technical and domain focus.

## Pre-review
An editor will confirm reviewers interest to review the notebook by tagging them into a pre-review issue within the main EDS book repository.
The pre-review issue contains some apriori information of the notebook including a link to the notebook idea issue. 

## Review
After confirming reviewers availability, the editor opens a review issue to moderate a high-level discussion between notebook authors and reviewers. 

To review a notebook, we provide a review template (see below) with a checklist.

```{include} ../templates/review-template.md
```

Copy and paste the above checklist as a comment into the notebook-review issue.

Additional comments are welcome in the same issue or directly to the notebook repo if you choose. 

If reviewers do the latter, we encourage cross-referencing them within a notebook-review repo comment thread. This facilitates centralizing comments.

Authors should respond within 3 weeks with their changes to the notebook in response to reviewers comments.
