# Guide for Notebooks Editors
Welcome to the guide for notebooks editors of the EDS book! 

Before you begin this process, please be sure to [understand how the publication process works](pb-guidelines).

We have a [code of conduct](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alan-turing-institute/environmental-ds-book/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which is mandatory for everyone involved in the review process of our notebooks.

Below you will find the main steps we suggest to follow as an editor of a notebook to EDS book.

## Scope and Aims
Thank you for considering managing the review workflow of a notebook submission to EDS book.
Our review process aims to be open, collaborative, transparent and inclusive. 
We therefore welcome editors from a diversity of background and with varying levels of programming/domain expertise.

## Pre-review
Once a notebook idea comes in, it will be validated by Editors-in-Chief (EiC). 
From there, it moves to a PRE-REVIEW issue, where EIC will assign an editor (or a volunteering editor self-assigns).

### Finding Reviewers
The editor's job is to identify reviewers (or validate authors' suggestions) who have sufficient expertise in the field of software and/in the domain of the submission. 
EDS book notebooks have to have a minimum of two reviewers per submission.
In some cases, the editor also might want to formally add themself as one of the reviewers. 
If the editor feels particularly unsure of the submission, a third reviewer can be recruited. 

## Review
EiC will open a REVIEW issue containing some instructions with the review checklist, one per reviewer.
Reviewers should check off items of the checklist one-by-one, until done. 
In the meantime, reviewers can engage the authors freely in a conversation aimed at improving the notebook.
The editor lurks on this conversation and comes in if needed for questions (or CoC issues).
Comments in the REVIEW issue should be kept general with more lengthy suggestions or requests posted directly in the PR opened by EiC in the notebook repository. 

When reviewers are satisfied with the improvements, the editor asks to confirm their recommendation to accept the submission.
Then the editor pings EiC to inform the notebook is ready to the post-print stage.
