# Guide for Notebooks Community

Welcome to the guide for notebooks community of the EDS book! 

Before you begin this process, please be sure to [understand how the publication process works](pb-guidelines).

We have a [code of conduct](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alan-turing-institute/environmental-ds-book/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) which is mandatory for everyone involved in the review process of our notebooks.

Below you will find the main steps we suggest to follow to participate in a discussion of a submitted notebook to EDS book.

## Scope and Aims
Thank you for considering contributing to the review workflow of a notebook submission to EDS book.
Our review process aims to be collaborative, transparent and inclusive. 
We therefore welcome community feedback from a diversity of background and with varying levels of programming/domain expertise.

Previous submissions had a mix of technical and domain focus.

## Notebook Idea

We highly appreciate providing feedback to the notebook idea.
Any kind of suggestion related to datasets, open-source packages or ecosystems, credits, etc will be valuable for authors.  

## Post-publication
We encourage post-publication feedback from anyone interested in published notebooks in EDS book.

You can report bugs and derivative work in the notebook repository hosted by the [Environmental-DS-Book organisation](https://github.com/Environmental-DS-Book) (see for instance a [PR](https://github.com/Environmental-DS-Book/forest-modelling-treecrown_deepforest/pull/1) in the DeepForest notebook)
