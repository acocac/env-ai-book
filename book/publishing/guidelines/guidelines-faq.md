# FAQ

## Authorship
The authors themselves assume responsibility for deciding who should be credited with co-authorship, and co-authors must always agree to be listed. In addition, co-authors agree to be accountable for all aspects of the work, and to notify EDS book if any retraction or correction of mistakes are needed after publication.

## Confidential requests
Please write environmental.ds.book@gmail.com with confidential matters such as retraction requests, report of misconduct, and retroactive author name changes.

In case of a name change, the DOI will be unchanged and the notebook will be updated without publishing a correction notice or notifying co-authors.
