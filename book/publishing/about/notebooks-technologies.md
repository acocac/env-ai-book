# Technologies in EDS Book Notebooks

This section aims to indicate the technologies for peer-reviewing EDS book notebooks.

## Review

## Research object
Research objects (ROs) are living resources helping to organise and describe the inputs, materials, and methods used in a scientific experiment and obtained as a result and not only at the end when publishing the research outcomes{cite}`ttw-2022`.

## RoHub
RoHub is a Research Object management platform that enables researchers to collaboratively manage, share and preserve their research work (data, software, workflows, models, presentations, videos, articles, etc.). 
RoHub implements the full RO model and paradigm: resources associated to a particular research work are aggregated into a single FAIR digital object, and metadata relevant for understanding and interpreting the content is represented as semantic metadata that are user and machine readable.
