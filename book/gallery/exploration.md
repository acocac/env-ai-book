# Exploration

This section contains all notebooks related to data visualisation and exploration of sensor and/or environmental datasets. 

We suggest to explore open-source libraries for interactive plotting e.g. [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/) and where possible download the dataset from the original provider.
