# About this book

_The EDS book_ showcase and support the publication of data, research and open-source tools using **Data Science and AI** for monitoring and modelling a wide diversity of environmental systems. 

Through the publication of executable use cases e.g. Jupyter Notebooks, the resource aims to be a **living**, **open** and **community-driven** online resource guiding the scientific community about information extraction and analysis from environmental sensors (including ground sensors, drones, and satellite Earth observations) and other type of data from a wide diversity of sources, innovative research and open-source tools.

In addition to the book, our goal is to build a community dedicated to making collaborative, reusable and transparent Environmental data science research. 
In this regard, we host online {ref}`Co-working sessions <cm-coworking>` aiming to engage anyone interested in learning and discussing relevant themes in data science and AI to help understand our changing planet.
