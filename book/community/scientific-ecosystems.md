# Scientific Ecosystems
There is a wide diversity of open source software (OSS) suited to Environmental research. 

Awareness of such developments across programming languages could help decide which is more appropriate for a specific environmental analysis task if not subject to personal choice.

We present below an introduction and description of main languages for Open Environmental Data Science according to the [Open Sustainable Technology](https://opensustain.tech/) project and its [recent report](https://report.opensustain.tech/chapters/index.html) of Open Source in Environmental Sustainability{cite}`Augspurger2023_OpenSustainability`.

The report provides a comprehensible examination of the health and state of OSS ecosystem in sustainability and climate technology and evaluates the impact of open source culture on environmental sustainability.

Authors identified 1339 OSS projects worldwide. Of these, 1188 projects are hosted on GitHub, 27 on GitLab and 125 on other websites or self-hosted Git platforms{cite}`Augspurger2023_OpenSustainability`.

# Ecosystems for Environmental Data Science

Python, R and Julia are the main languages for environmental science.
