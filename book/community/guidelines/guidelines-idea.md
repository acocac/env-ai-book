# Notebook idea

Submission of a notebook idea (NBI) as simple as:

* Open a NBI [issue](https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/environmental-ds-book/issues/new/choose).
* Fill the NBI template (see {numref}`guideline-idea_open`) with some description of the notebook and information about the input data and target theme.
* Waiting for the editorial team and/or community (optional) to feedback the submission.
* Once you pass the minimal review from the managing editor and/or community, we encourage to move to the preparation stage.
