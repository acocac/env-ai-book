# About EDS book community

Inspired by [_The Turing Way_ collaboration cafes](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/coworking/coworking-collabcafe.html), our community had some virtual meetings between 2021 and 2022 with the following two group-oriented formats:
* Community (6 in total): focused on onboarding new members, support and celebrate members achievements or contributions to open environmental data science.
  * Collaborations cafes (5 in total): for shared experience, connection, support and collaboration among the distributed _EDS book_ community (see shared notes [here](https://hackmd.io/@eds-book/collaboration-cafe)).
  * Show & tell (1 in total): for shared celebrations and feedback of what EDS book community has accomplished in research and/or software developments (see shared notes [here](https://hackmd.io/@eds-book/show-tell)).
* Working groups (12 in total): focused on specific areas .
  * Publishing (5 in total): for shared work with project interns, collaborators and members interested in submitting or suggesting features to our publishing workflow of EDS book notebooks (see shared notes [here](https://hackmd.io/@eds-book/publishing-wg-notes)). 
  * Infrastructure Maintainers (7 in total): for shared discussions in bugs, enhancement and other infrastructure-related topics (see shared notes [here](https://hackmd.io/@eds-book/infrastructure-wg-notes)).

While the above virtual spaces were fruitful and productive with lots of fun interacting with each other, we are not longer supporting some of them. Please find below the proposed community and team meetings to discuss important topics and to invite broader participation from others.
